# **MDST W26 Project: Algorithmic Trading**

This is an advanced project through MDST that builds an algorithmic trading pipeline that starts with raw market data and ends with an evaluated trading strategy. 
We'll collect historical financial data, perform data processing and feature engineering to create informative signals, and incorporate market regime detection to capture different market conditions. 
From there, we'll design a custom trading simulation environment and train a reinforcement learning agent to learn trading behavior from the engineered state space while accounting for realistic constraints.
